    "# Topic extraction using LLMs only\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional ML ways of topic extraction rely on converting each message into a vector in some vector space, and then clustering in that vector space. \"Topics\" are then really just regions in that vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several weaknesses: Even interpreting such clusters is not trivial; editing them after the fit, let alone specifying an initial list of human-defined topics, to be automatically expanded if necessary, is pretty much impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show a different way, using only LLM calls. It works as follows: we feed one message at the time to the topic processor; it either assigns it to one of the existing topics, or if none are a good fit, puts it aside. Once the number of messages put aside reaches a threshold, these are used to extract a new topic, which is added to the list. There is also the option of generating topich hierarchies, by setting `max_depth` to a value bigger than 1.\n"
